üêç Python Essentials Projects ‚Äì 7 Day Challenge
This repository contains a structured collection of Python projects created during a 7-day hands-on learning sprint covering Python Essentials 1 & 2, and 3 projects showing my grasp into AI and Data Science.

Each project builds upon concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, OOP, modules, file handling, and more.
Three projects showing  my grasp on Data Science and AI concepts.
1. MovieLens Data Explorer ( Data Science project)
2. Resume Analyzer and Job Matcher (AI)
3. Ai Chatbot - cli based (AI)
