🐍 Python Essentials Projects – 7 Day Challenge
This repository contains a structured collection of Python projects created during a 7-day hands-on learning sprint covering Python Essentials 1 & 2, and a transition into AI/Data Science.

Each project builds upon concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, OOP, modules, file handling, and more.

📅 Project Breakdown

✅ Day 1: Core Python Basics
Projects built using conditionals, loops, I/O, and simple logic.

number_guessing_game.py – Guess the random number with hints

simple_calculator.py – Perform +, −, ×, ÷ using user input

even_or_odd_checker.py – Check if the given number is even or odd

password_generator.py – Random strong password generator

student_grade_calculator.py – Total, percentage, and grade calculator

✅ Day 2: Conditionals & File-Free Tools
Beginner logic-based and utility projects using core constructs.

leap_year_checker.py – Determine if a year is a leap year

basic_todo_list.py – Add/view/delete tasks from a to-do list

simple_contact_book.py – Store names and numbers (list-only version)

currency_converter.py – Convert amount from one currency to another

bmi_calculator.py – Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI)

✅ Day 3: Intermediate Python Logic
Projects involving loops, string/list methods, exception handling, and moderate logic.

number_to_words_converter.py – Convert digits to English words (e.g. 123 → "one two three")

prime_number_checker.py – Check whether a number is prime

mini_quiz_game.py – A terminal-based quiz with multiple-choice answers

stopwatch_timer.py – Timer app with start/stop/wait functionality

file_word_counter.py – Read a .txt file and count total words

✅ Day 4: Files, Validation, and Modules
Hands-on practice with file I/O, exception handling, and user input validation.

email_validator.py – Validate email format using basic string rules

contact_book_with_file_handling.py – Add/search/delete contacts stored in a file

string_analyzer_tool.py – Analyze user text: word count, char count, frequency

employee_payroll_calculator.py – Simple salary, tax, and net pay calculator

✅ Day 5: OOP and Applied Concepts
Practice object-oriented programming and intermediate data processing.

bank_account_oop.py – OOP-based bank account system (deposit, withdraw)

student_record_manager.py – Create/update/search student records using OOP

file_backup_tool.py – Copy files from one folder to another with logging

weather_data_logger.py – Log and analyze fake temperature data using datetime

simple_directory_cleaner.py – Organize files by type using os module

✅ Day 6: Advanced Projects
More advanced and functional Python utilities using classes, file ops, exceptions.

url_shortener.py – Custom short URLs for long links (basic mapping version)

terminal_chat_simulator.py – Chat with a preset personality using logic trees

sales_data_analyzer.py – Read & summarize CSV data (no pandas)

text_file_merger.py – Combine multiple .txt files into one

expense_tracker.py – Track and categorize monthly expenses from user input

✅ Day 7: AI & Data Science Transition
Projects that build bridges into AI, automation, and data science concepts.

ai_chatbot_basic.py – Rule-based chatbot with basic NLP logic

csv_data_cleaner.py – Clean messy .csv (remove blanks, normalize casing, etc.)

email_auto_formatter.py – Auto-format input as a formal email

ocr_invoice_extractor.py – Extract text from image-based invoice using OCR

weather_forecast_visualizer.py – Fetch & plot dummy weather trends (line chart)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- No external libraries for most projects (except a few with `random`, `datetime`, etc.)

### Run a Project
```bash
python filename.py 
```
