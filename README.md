🐍 Python Essentials Projects – 7 Day Challenge
This repository contains a structured collection of Python projects created during a 7-day hands-on learning sprint covering Python Essentials 1 & 2, and a transition into AI/Data Science.

Each project builds upon concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, OOP, modules, file handling, and more.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- No external libraries for most projects (except a few with `random`, `datetime`, etc.)

### Run a Project
```bash
python filename.py 
```
