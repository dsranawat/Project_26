üêç Python Essentials Projects ‚Äì 7 Day Challenge
This repository contains a structured collection of Python projects created during a 7-day hands-on learning sprint covering Python Essentials 1 & 2, and a transition into AI/Data Science.

Each project builds upon concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, OOP, modules, file handling, and more.
Two projects show my transition to Data Science / AI
1. MovieLens Data Explorer ( Data Science project)
2. Resume Analyzer and Job Matcher (AI)
3. Ai Chatbot - cli based (AI)
